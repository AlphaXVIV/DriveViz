# DriveViz

> A fork of TMViz: for web-based controller visualisation widget for any driving game.

**DriveViz** is a lightweight, web-based controller visualisation widget for streaming apps like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [XSplit](https://www.xsplit.com/). Originally made for [TrackMania](https://trackmania.com/), the layout has been changed to accomodate racing games with three pedals (clutch, brake, accelerate).
