**TMViz** is a web-based controller visualisation widget for streaming apps like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [XSplit](https://www.xsplit.com/).

## Why does this exist?

- I want an overlay that can be included as a browser source
- I want my overlays to be customisable
- I don't want to run any other app locally just to run an overlay.
